# Updated Fitness Function with Bin Optimization Score

## New Fitness Formula

```
F = W × valueScore + ((1 - W) / 2) × areaScore + ((1 - W) / 2) × binOptimizedScore
```

## Components

### 1. **valueScore** (Weight: W)
- **Definition**: `priceOfStoredProducts / totalInventoryPrice`
- **Range**: [0, 1]
- **Purpose**: Maximizes the total value of items placed in storage
- **Calculation**: Sum of prices of all items in bins 1 to numBins

### 2. **areaScore** (Weight: (1-W)/2)
- **Definition**: `areaOfStoredProducts / totalBinArea`
- **Range**: [0, 1]
- **Purpose**: Maximizes the utilization of available bin space
- **Calculation**: Sum of areas of all items in bins divided by total bin capacity

### 3. **binOptimizedScore** (Weight: (1-W)/2) - **NEW**
- **Definition**: `sum(binScores) / numBins`
- **Range**: [0, 1]
- **Purpose**: Penalizes wasted bin space when items are left outside that could fit
- **Calculation**:
  - For each bin:
    - Calculate `freeArea = binArea - usedArea`
    - Check if ANY item from bin 0 (outside) has `area ≤ freeArea`
    - If YES (item could fit): bin score = 0 (penalty)
    - If NO (no item can fit): bin score = 1 (optimal)
  - Average all bin scores

## Weight Distribution

With default W = 0.7:
- **valueScore**: 70% influence
- **areaScore**: 15% influence
- **binOptimizedScore**: 15% influence

The non-value components (area + bin optimization) total to (1 - W) = 30%, split equally.

## How binOptimizedScore Works

### Example Scenario 1: Poor Optimization
```
Bins:
- Bin 1: Capacity=100, Used=50, Free=50
- Bin 2: Capacity=100, Used=80, Free=20
- Bin 3: Capacity=100, Used=100, Free=0

Items Outside (Bin 0):
- Item A: Area=30
- Item B: Area=60

Analysis:
- Bin 1: Item A (30) ≤ Free(50) ✓ → Can fit → Score = 0
- Bin 2: Item A (30) ≤ Free(20) ✗, Item B (60) ≤ Free(20) ✗ → Cannot fit → Score = 1
- Bin 3: Free=0 → Cannot fit → Score = 1

binOptimizedScore = (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67
```

### Example Scenario 2: Good Optimization
```
Bins:
- Bin 1: Capacity=100, Used=95, Free=5
- Bin 2: Capacity=100, Used=90, Free=10
- Bin 3: Capacity=100, Used=100, Free=0

Items Outside (Bin 0):
- Item A: Area=30
- Item B: Area=60

Analysis:
- Bin 1: Item A (30) ≤ Free(5) ✗, Item B (60) ≤ Free(5) ✗ → Cannot fit → Score = 1
- Bin 2: Item A (30) ≤ Free(10) ✗, Item B (60) ≤ Free(10) ✗ → Cannot fit → Score = 1
- Bin 3: Free=0 → Cannot fit → Score = 1

binOptimizedScore = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0
```

### Example Scenario 3: Perfect Optimization
```
All items are stored (bin 0 is empty)

binOptimizedScore = 1.0 (maximum)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Prevents Lazy Solutions**
The GA can't just leave small items outside when there's clearly space for them. It must efficiently use available bin space.

### 2. **Encourages Tight Packing**
Solutions that pack items tightly (leaving only unusable small gaps) are rewarded.

### 3. **Balanced Optimization**
The formula balances three goals:
- Store high-value items (valueScore)
- Use bin space efficiently (areaScore)
- Don't waste space that could store outside items (binOptimizedScore)

### 4. **Simple Area-Based Check**
Uses only area comparison (not position/rotation), making it computationally efficient.

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: All Items Stored
```
itemsOutside.isEmpty() = true
binOptimizedScore = 1.0
```
Maximum score - perfect solution.

### Case 2: All Bins Full
```
For each bin: freeArea ≈ 0
No outside items can fit
binOptimizedScore = 1.0
```
No penalty - bins are legitimately full.

### Case 3: Items Outside, Bins Have Space
```
Some bins have freeArea > 0
Some outside items have area ≤ freeArea
Those bins get score = 0
binOptimizedScore = partial (0 to 1)
```
Penalty applied - solution should be improved.

## Example Fitness Calculation

**Setup:**
- W = 0.75
- priceOfStoredProducts = 180, totalInventoryPrice = 200
- areaOfStoredProducts = 450, totalBinArea = 500
- binOptimizedScore = 0.67 (from Example 1 above)

**Calculation:**
```
valueScore = 180 / 200 = 0.90
areaScore = 450 / 500 = 0.90
binOptimizedScore = 0.67

F = 0.75 × 0.90 + ((1 - 0.75) / 2) × 0.90 + ((1 - 0.75) / 2) × 0.67
F = 0.75 × 0.90 + 0.125 × 0.90 + 0.125 × 0.67
F = 0.675 + 0.1125 + 0.08375
F = 0.87125
```

## Impact on Evolution

### Solutions Favored:
✅ High-value items stored  
✅ Bins well-utilized  
✅ No wasted space with outside items that could fit  

### Solutions Penalized:
❌ Valuable items left outside  
❌ Bins underutilized  
❌ Items outside when bins have available space  

## Comparison: Old vs New

| Aspect | Old Formula | New Formula |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Value Focus** | W × valueScore | W × valueScore |
| **Space Use** | (1-W) × areaScore | (1-W)/2 × areaScore |
| **Bin Optimization** | Not considered | (1-W)/2 × binOptimizedScore |
| **Wasted Space** | Not penalized | Penalized if items could fit |
| **Tight Packing** | Indirectly encouraged | Directly encouraged |

## Tuning Recommendations

- **W = 0.7-0.8**: Balanced (recommended)
- **W > 0.8**: Prioritize high-value items
- **W < 0.7**: Prioritize space efficiency and optimization

The split of (1-W) between areaScore and binOptimizedScore ensures that non-value objectives are balanced.
